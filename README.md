FOREX FLOOD MA LINES TREND SERIES FOR MACHINE LEARNING (MQL - MetaTrader)

Generate Flood MA lines and perform relational trend analysis. Utilize Machine Learning to generate trend series suitable for Deep Learning applications. These trend series enable the extraction of insights based on various parametric data, including the current trend analysis for any pair, trend robustness, and price range expectations.

The open-source mass production algorithm I've released facilitates the interpretation of flooded series of Moving Average (MA) trend lines and their corresponding trends within a single series. You can access the code on my GitHub page, where it's available for personal projects with attribution specified (via a link to both YouTube and GitHub).
